## Manual steps for setting up the build environment

This repo contains bash scripts to setup a build enviroment to use DeviceBuilder with IOTivity-lite.
The script setup the next repos (from git) in the folders:

- iotivity-lite (latest version)
- DeviceBuilder (latest version)

Typical folder layout to start from (e.g. create the iot-lite folder in the home folder)

     ~/iot-lite

clone in this folder:

```git clone https://github.com/openconnectivity/IOTivity-Lite-setup.git```

This command will give the next folder structure :

     ~/iot-lite
        |-IOTivity-Lite-setup 

From the IOTivity-Lite-setup folder run the scripts (in order):

- install_IOTivity-lite.sh
- install_DeviceBuilder.sh

e.g. exectute in the \<>/iot-lite/IOTivity-Lite-setup folder: sh install_\<>.sh

## update_repos.sh

The update_repos.sh script updates the:

- tooling repos
- datamodels repos

The script does NOT update the code repos:

- iotivity-lite
The code repo iotivity is pulled at start up with a specific version.
To get a fresh copy, delete the folder and rerun the install_IOTivity.sh script.

## Compiling on windows

Using vs2017:

- Do the generation of the code as is with sh gen.sh.
- This step creates in the folder iotivity-lite (to be renamed) /apps the file device_builder_server.c
  - copy this file over the existing simpleserver_windows.code (not nice, but it works)
- start up visual studio project "SimpleServer" in folder :
  - \iotivity-lite\port\windows\vs2015
  - IoTivity-Constrained project is the library, e.g. can't be runned.
- when using visual studio 2017 instead of 2015: to a retarget on project.

Resetting the device to ready for onboarding:
delete the folder:

- iotivity-lite\port\windows\vs2015\Debug\x64\simpleserver_creds
