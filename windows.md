## Installation

Installation of IoTivity-Lite as indicated in the [main flow](/Readme.md#development-flow).

Folder structure after everything is installed and the code is generated:

    ~/iot-lite        
        |-- core             core resource definitions (in swagger)
        |-- DeviceBuilder    The device builder tool chain
        |-- device_output    The output of device builder.
        |         |
        |         |-- code   The generated code.
        |               |    the files will be copied to folder iotivity/examples/OCFDeviceBuilder
        |               |- server.cpp
        |               |- server_security.dat         SVR data
        |               |- server_introspection.dat.h  introspection device data, encoded in header file
        |
        |-- iotivity-lite         IOTivity source code
        |        | 
        |        |-- apps
        |        |      |- simpleserver_windows.c            <--- generated code
        |        |      |- simpleserver_windows.c_org        <--- original application 
        |        |      |- cloud_server.c                    <--- generated code
        |        |      |- cloud_server.c_org                <--- original application 
        |        |
        |        |-- include
        |        |      |- server_introspection.dat.h         <--- generated introspection data
        |        |
        |        |-- port/windows/vs2015
        |                          |- IoTivity-lite.vcxproj   <--- project file
        |                          |- IoTivity-lite.sln       <--- solution file (load this file)
        |                          |- SimpleClient.vcxproj    <--- project file 
        |                          |- SimpleServer.vcxproj    <--- project file
        |                          |- ...
        |                   
        |-- IOTDataModels    OCF resource definitions (in swagger format)
        |-- IOTivity-Lite-setup   This github repo.
        |-- swagger2x        swagger2x code generation
        |- gen.sh            generation command to convert the example.json in to code
        |- example.json      the input for device builder scripts.
            
            
     legenda:  folder
                  |-- folder
                  |-- folder/subfolder
                  |- file

The installDeviceBuilder script generates scripts in the folder above this repo.
These scripts are convienent scripts, e.g. they are short cuts for entering the generation command. Note that the scripts contain linux based commands, thus build and run will not work.

## Compile Flags

To build with the generated introspection file the 
precompile flag ```OC_IDD_API``` **MUST be disabled** in the IoTivity-lite project.

To remove the debugging disable the precompile flag ```OC_DEBUG``` in the IoTivity-lite project.

## Development flow  

The development flow is depicted the figure below:

                   start
                     |       
                     v
               --------------                  
              |              |     
              | edit_input.sh|             --- edit the input file for the code generation
              |              |                 default file contains the binary switch resource
               -------------- 
                     |
                     |       
                     v
               --------------
              |              |
              |    gen.sh    |             ---  generates the code & introspection file
              |              |             --- script contains the device type, 
               --------------                  change the argument to change the device type.
                     |
                     | initial code        --- in iotivity-lite tree, to build
                     v                     --- introspection header files
               --------------                  
              |              |     
              |    visual    |<--------    --- edit/compile/run the generated code
              |    studio    |         
               --------------       
 
        Note: if gen.sh is run again, the generated code is overwritten.
        e.g. before running that tool again, safe the file in the iotivivty tree to another name 
        if one wants to keep that code as reference

## Initial Flow

Based on visual studio community 2017, version 15.7.1

The Initial flow is doing a generation (with the supplied example):
1. [gen.sh](#generate-code)
2. Start up visual code/studio with the IoTivity-Lite solution file (.sln)
   note dependend on the use version of studio/code solution conversion will take place.
3. Retarget the solution, so that it actual builds
   tab -> Project -> Retarget solution
4. Set the SimpleServer as start up project
   solution explorer -> SimpleServer -> Set as StartUp Project
5. Tab -> Build -> Build Solution
6. Tab -> Debug -> Start Debugging

For building the cloud version of the generated code replace steps 4-6 with the steps below.

4. Set the CloudServer as start up project
   solution explorer -> SimpleServer -> Set as StartUp Project
5. Tab -> Build -> Build Solution
6. Tab -> Debug -> Start Debugging

## Installation of visual studio

See [microsoft](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) to install visual studio (community edition) on your windows machine.
